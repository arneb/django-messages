==========================================
A user-to-user messaging system for Django
==========================================

Django-messages enables your users to send private messages to each other.
It provides a basic set of functionality that you would expect from such a system.
Every user has an Inbox, an Outbox and a Trash. Messages can be composed and
there is an easy, url-based approach to preloading the compose-form with the
recipient-user, which makes it extremly easy to put "send xyz a message" links
on a profile-page.

Currently django-messages comes with these translations:

* ar (thanks to speedy)
* da (thanks Michael Lind Mortensen)
* de
* el (thanks Markos Gogoulos)
* es (thanks paz.lupita)
* es_AR (thanks Juanjo-sfe)
* eu (thanks urtzai)
* fa
* fr (thanks froland and dpaccoud)
* it (thanks to Sergio Morstabilini)
* lt
* ko
* nl (thanks krisje8)
* pl (thanks maczewski)
* pt_BR (thanks Diego Martins)
* ru (thanks overkrik)
* zh_CN (thanks Gene Wu)

Documentation
-------------

The documentation is contained in the /docs/ directory and can be build with
sphinx. A HTML version of the documentation is available at:
http://django-messages.readthedocs.org


Install
-------
Download the tar archive, unpack and run python setup.py install or checkout
the trunk and put the ``django_messages`` folder on your ``PYTHONPATH``.
Released versions of django-messages are also available on pypi and can be
installed with easy_install or pip.


Usage
-----

Add ``django_messages`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting and add an
``include('django_messages.urls')`` at any point in your url-conf.

The app includes some default templates, which are pretty simple. They
extend a template called ``base.html`` and only emit stuff in the block
``content`` and block ``sidebar``. You may want to use your own templates,
but the included ones are good enough for testing and getting started.


Dependencies
------------

Django-messages has no external dependencies except for django. However, if
pinax-notifications and/or django-mailer are found, it will make use of them.
Note: as of r65 django-messages will only use pinax-notifications if
'pinax.notifications' is also added to the INSTALLED_APPS setting. This has been
done to make situations possible where notification is on pythonpath but
should not be used, or where notification is another python package, such as
django-notification which has the same name.
