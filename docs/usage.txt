=====================
Using django-messages
=====================

To enable django-messages in your Django project make sure it is 
:ref:`installed <ref-messages-install>`. You can check if django-messages was 
successfully installed by opening a python shell and running::

    >>> import messages
    >>>
    
If no error occured, you can assumed that the app was installed correctly.


Edit settings
-------------

The next step is to add ``messsages`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'messages',
        ...
    )


Add urls
--------

To make django-messages available to your users you should include the 
bunlded url-conf in your root url-conf. One example would be to edit
your main ``urls.py`` and add a line like this::

    urlpatterns = patterns(''
        ...
        (r'^messages/', include('messages.urls')),
        ...
    )
    
    
Templates
---------

Django-messages provides some simple default templates which will get you
started quick. The templates make the assumption that a base template with
the name ``base.html`` exists which defines a block ``content`` and a block 
``sidebar``. If this is not the case, or the template don't fit due to other
concerns, it's very easy to provide to your own templates. Please see the
:ref:`customization docs <ref-messages-customization>` fore more details.
