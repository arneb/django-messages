Installing django-messages
==========================

Basically all you have to do is get the ``messages`` folder somewhere on the 
Python path. There are multiple ways to achive this.

Quickstart
----------

If you already downloaded the package change into the ``django-messages`` 
directory and run::

    python setup.py install

Otherwise you will find more information in the remainder of this document.
    
Django-messages is available via PyPi, so the following command will download
and install django-messages on your system in one step::

    easy_install django-messages
    
If you prefer using pip, you may achieve the same result by running::

    pip install django-messages


Download
---------

You will always find and download the latest packaged version at: 
http://code.google.com/p/django-messages/downloads/list

If you prefer to use the current developement version to get earlier access to
new features you can checkout the code from the GIT repository::

    git clone https://github.com/arneb/django-messages.git
    

Install
-------

If you downloaded the tar-ball extract it with (change the version number if
required)::

    tar -xcvf django-messages-0.4.tar.gz

After extracting the tar-ball or checking out the code from the repository, 
change into the ``django-messages`` directory and install the code::

    cd django-messages
    python setup.py install
    

Manual Install
--------------

Instead of using ``setup.py install`` it is also possible to copy or symlink
the ``django_messages`` folder inside the toplevel ``django-messages`` folder 
to your Python path. This will be enough to make djano-messages available to 
your system.


Dependencies
------------

Django-messages has no external dependencies except for Django. Starting with
version 0.4 Django 1.1 or later is required. Version 0.3 works with Django 1.0.
If you have to use Django 0.96.x you might still use version 0.2 (unsupported).

Django-messages has some features which may use an external app if it is 
present in the current Django project. Please note, that these apps have to
be listed in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` to be used by django-messages.

* If you use `django-notification`_ django-messages will use it for sending
  notifications to users about new messages instead of using the built-in
  mechanism
  
* If `django-mailer`_ is used the built-in messages sending code will use it
  instead of the django built-in ``send_mail`` function.

Please note that we try to support Python 2.4, but as we develop django-messages
on Python 2.5 sometimes code might slip in which breaks Python 2.4 compatibility.
This can be considered a bug and you can help us by reporting the incompytibility.
